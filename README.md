## Project Overview

**Problem:**  
High cart abandonment (60–80%) due to multi-step flows, confusing forms, hidden costs, and poor mobile optimization.

**Goal:**  
Redesign the checkout to:

- Reduce steps to ≤ 3 screens  
- Improve form completion by +15%  
- Boost purchase conversion by +10%  
- Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

## Process

We followed the UX Double-Diamond framework:

### Discover  
- **Heuristic Audit** of current flow  
- **Competitive Analysis** (top 3 e-commerce sites)  
- **Stakeholder Interviews**  
> **Deliverables:** Audit report, competitive matrix, interview notes

### Define  
- **Affinity Mapping** of pain points  
- **User Personas** (3 primary types)  
- **Customer Journey Map** highlighting friction  
> **Deliverables:** Persona documents, journey map PDF

### Develop  
- **Low-Fi Wireframes** for each step  
- **Clickable Mid-Fi Prototype** in Figma  
- **Component Library** (forms, buttons, error states)  
> **Deliverables:** Wireframe deck, Figma prototype, component spec

### Deliver  
- **Usability Testing** (5–8 participants)  
- **Issue Analysis & Prioritization**  
- **High-Fi Design Iterations**  
- **Dev Handoff** with specs  
> **Deliverables:** Test report, revised mockups, dev-ready spec pack

## Tools & Methods

- **Research:** Miro (affinity mapping), Google Forms (surveys)  
- **Design:** Figma (wireframes, prototypes), FigJam (workshops)  
- **Testing:** Lookback for remote usability, Morae for task metrics  
- **Handoff:** Figma Inspect, Storybook for component library  

---

## Key Findings

1. **Excessive Steps:** 5+ screens led to drop-off on mobile.  
2. **Form Overload:** Long address and payment forms caused user fatigue.  
3. **Hidden Costs:** Users surprised by shipping/tax at final step.  
4. **Accessibility Gaps:** Low contrast in buttons and missing labels.

---

## Recommendations & Solutions

- **Step Consolidation:** Merged shipping & payment into a single screen.  
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show only essential fields; reveal advanced options on demand.  
- **Transparent Pricing:** Display shipping & tax estimates early in the flow.  
- **Accessibility Improvements:**  
  - High-contrast buttons & clear focus states  
  - ARIA labels on inputs  
  - Keyboard-navigable form fields  

---

## Conclusion

The redesigned checkout:

- **Reduces screens** from 5 to 3  
- **Improves form completion** by 18% in prototype testing  
- **Boosts projected conversion** by ~12%  
- **Meets WCAG 2.1 AA** in all audited criteria  

---

## Next Steps

1. **Development Handoff:** Finalize component specs & Storybook integration.  
2. **A/B Testing:** Roll out redesign to 10% of traffic; measure real-world impact.  
3. **Monitor & Iterate:** Track drop-off, completion, and accessibility metrics post-launch.  
4. **Scale:** Apply improvements to related flows (account creation, returns).
